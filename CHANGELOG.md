# Changelog

## 2026-08-16

### Added

- Created the billed Google Cloud project `yahatvp-pipeline-eu` in
  `europe-west1`.
- Created the dedicated archive bucket `yahatvp-pipeline-eu-data` with uniform
  bucket-level access, public access prevention, and object versioning.
- Created the `hatvp` Artifact Registry repository.
- Created separate `hatvp-runtime`, `hatvp-scheduler`, and `hatvp-deployer`
  service accounts.
- Created a GitHub Workload Identity Pool and OIDC provider restricted to
  `louispaulet/YAHATVP` on `main`.
- Configured the eight non-secret GitHub repository variables required by
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Deployed the `hatvp-ingestion` Cloud Run Job with BigQuery disabled for the
  first smoke test.

### Changed

- Replaced the README architecture ASCII diagram with a Mermaid flowchart.
- Updated GitHub Actions to build and push the container directly from the
  GitHub runner, avoiding the failing Cloud Build source-staging path.
- Kept the deployer separate from the runtime identity and removed the
  temporary Cloud Build-specific IAM grants after verification.

### Verified

- GitHub Actions run [31971826703](https://github.com/louispaulet/YAHATVP/actions/runs/31971826703)
  passed tests, Ruff, Docker build/push, and Cloud Run deployment.
- Cloud Run execution `hatvp-ingestion-q78jz` completed successfully.
- Snapshot `2026-08-16` wrote raw XML/CSV and metadata, normalized Parquet
  tables, quarantine anomalies, a quality report, and `state/latest.json`.
- The quality report contained zero errors, 3,510 warnings, and 5,763 flagged
  records; those records still need review.

### Pending

- Configure and manually validate the weekly Europe/Paris Cloud Scheduler
  trigger.
- Decide whether to enable and validate BigQuery.

## 2026-08-16 — Local hardening

### Added

- Added fixtures covering all observed asset DTO sections, liabilities, empty
  optional declaration sections, and missing `general` blocks.
- Added regression tests for changed XML/CSV hashes, BigQuery state-update
  gating, immutable same-date raw snapshots, catastrophic row-count reductions,
  negative asset flags, and required XML top-level structure.

### Changed

- Added streaming checks for the required XML root and top-level declaration
  container before declaration normalization.
- Made row-count checks explicit and limited them to the previous successful
  quality report.
- Documented normalized table grains, important fields, and first-snapshot
  quality triage in the README.

### Verified

- Focused parser, quality, and pipeline tests pass: 17 tests.
- Live quality report review classified repeated names and asset outliers as
  retained review flags, negative bank balances as source-valid-but-flagged,
  and duplicate declaration UUIDs as actionable.
